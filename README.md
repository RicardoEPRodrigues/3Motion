# Divisaction

*RRodrigues* Production

Library that allows the creation of agents and their behaviour with the objective of creating more belieable scenes.

This library is based on a master thesis that defends the subdivision of an action into several stages to increase the immersion of the audience in a scene.

The writting of an article is currently underway, in the future it'll be shared a link here for it's download.
